# OCaml CLI To Do App

This is a project for learning the core concepts of OCaml by building a CLI todo app. The project was suggested by ChatGPT.

## Overview

_This project involves building a command-line application that allows users to manage their tasks. It's a practical way to learn OCaml's syntax, data types, and functional programming features._

### Core Concepts Covered

* Basic Syntax and Data Types: Learn the basic syntax of OCaml, including how to define variables, functions, and use basic data types like integers, strings, and booleans.
* Functional Programming Paradigms: Deepen your understanding of functional programming concepts such as immutability, first-class functions, and higher-order functions.
* Recursive Functions: Since iteration (like for-loops) is not commonly used in functional programming, this project will help you practice writing recursive functions.
* Algebraic Data Types and Pattern Matching: Use variants and records to model your to-do items and leverage pattern matching for elegant handling of different cases.
* Error Handling: Learn how to handle errors gracefully using options and result types.
* File I/O: Implement functionality to save and load tasks from a file, giving you practical experience with OCaml's input/output capabilities.
* Modules and Abstraction: Organize your code into modules, understanding how to structure larger OCaml programs effectively.

### Project Features

* Add a Task: Allows the user to add a new task to the list.
* View Tasks: Display all current tasks.
* Mark Task as Done: Mark a specific task as completed.
* Delete a Task: Remove a task from the list.
* Save/Load Tasks to/from a File: Persist tasks between sessions.

### Stretch Goals

* Task Prioritization: Add the ability to assign priorities to tasks and sort them accordingly.
* Due Dates: Implement due dates for tasks and functionality to view overdue tasks.
* Interactive CLI: Create an interactive command-line interface using a library like Lambda-Term.
